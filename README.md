# odin-recipes

This is part of the Odin Project foundational curriculum. I wish to finally learn proper HTML, CSS and JavaScript through this course and strengthen my skills as a proper web developer.

This current project is about creating a fully functional HTML (no CSS styling) site about recipes. Upon completing this site I will have proved that I can comprehend, edit and code basic HTML sites.
